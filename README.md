# using-html-and-css
#FreeApril on Pluralsight's platform offered some great courses for free.
So, I picked the one about HTML and CSS: Creating a Basic Website by John Friskics.

Here are the chapters covered by the course:
1. HTML (HTML tags and links)
2. CSS (CSS selectors, Hexadecimal colors, Box model)
3. Classes and Layouts (CSS selectors, divs and Layouts, Styles)
4. Images (Content images, Background images, Float images)
5. Fonts and forms (Adjusting font styles and Creating web forms)

The course consisted of 38 interactive challenges, which was super-useful to go through!
All basic knowledge of HTML and CSS is applied to my personal website in the repository biljana-zobenica.github.io.
